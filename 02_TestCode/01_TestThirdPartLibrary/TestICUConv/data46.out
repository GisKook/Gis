What is Tea? 

The leaves of a shrub grown chiefly in China and Japan; of which countries it is a native. It is an evergreen, grows to the height of from four to
six feet, and bears pretty white flowers, resembling wild roses.

Is there more than one species of the Tea Plant? 

Yes, several; those most cultivated are the Thea bohea and Thea viridis; it was formerly believed that these two plants produced the black and
green teas, and from this belief they derived their names; but it is now proved that the difference arises in the mode of preperation, and either
kind of tea can be made from either plant without difficulty.

How is the Tea Plant Cultivated?

In China there are great numbers of tea-farms, generally of small extent, situated on the upper valleys, and on the sloping sides of the hills,
where the soil is light and rich, and we;l drained. The plants are raised from seed, and generally allowed to remain three years before a crop of
leaves is takein from them, as this operation of course injures their growth; even with care, they become stunted, and unprofitable in about eight
or ten years. When the crop is ready, the leaves are carefully picked by hand one by one, and there are usually three or four gatherings in each
year, the first crop in the spring being of the most value; a well-grown bush, well treated, will produce two or three pounds of tea annually.
